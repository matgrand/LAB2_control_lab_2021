# Project: LAB2_control_lab_2021

A repo for a simple collaboration on lab2 of the control lab course 2021 in UNIPD

# Rules
-Add a "clear all" to the beginning of every .m file; to avoid confusing the variables, every .m file should re-create all the needed variables at every run. The execution may be slower but we avoid misunderstandigs. 

-All the simulink models should go in the models folder.

-Keep code readable and simple.

# Notes
-Remember to add the simulink_models folder to the path (right click > add to path).
