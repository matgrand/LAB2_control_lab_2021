# Project: LAB2_control_lab_2021

A repo for a simple collaboration on lab2 of the control lab course 2021 in UNIPD

# Instructions: importing the project
To import this project:

-Open Matlab, click on "new" > Project > From Git

-On repository path copy and paste https://github.com/matgrand/LAB2_control_lab_2021

-On sandbox choose where you want the project to be located on your pc.

-click retrieve and wait. You should now have all the files.


# Instructions: modifying files, importing changes...

-On the "Project" section you shuld spot the "Source control" section.

-Instead of "save" use COMMIT (on "enter a comment" just give a very small desription of what you did(good practice))

-To import changes made by others on your local version use PULL (do it often)

-To upload your changes use PUSH (after COMMIT)

# Good practices
-Add a "clear all" to the beginning of every .m file; to avoid confusing the variables, every .m file should re-create all the needed variables at every run. The execution may be slower but we avoid misunderstandings. 

-All the simulink models should go in the models folder.

-Keep code readable and simple.



# Notes
-To open the project, after you imported it, open matlab and double ckick on the .prj file

-Remember to add the simulink_models folder to the path (right click > add to path).
